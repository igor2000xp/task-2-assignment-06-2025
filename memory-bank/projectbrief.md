# Project Brief

## Project Overview
CSS Responsive Menu Bug Fix - Eliminating the "Ghosting" Effect at 768px Breakpoint

## Problem Statement
The responsive navigation menu exhibits a "ghosting" behavior exactly at the 768px viewport width where the menu slides in and out unexpectedly. This creates a poor user experience at the critical breakpoint between desktop and mobile layouts.

## Project Goals
1. **Identify Root Cause**: Determine the technical reason behind the sliding animation glitch at exactly 768px
2. **Implement Fix**: Produce a corrected `styles.css` file that eliminates the ghosting behavior
3. **Maintain Functionality**: Ensure the fix preserves intended responsive behavior below and above 768px
4. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensure the solution works across modern browsers

## Core Requirements
- Fix the specific issue where menu "ghosts" in and out at 768px
- Maintain existing responsive design behavior
- Keep the slide-down animation for mobile devices
- Preserve the horizontal layout for desktop/larger screens
- No changes to HTML structure required

## Current State
- HTML navigation structure is complete with hamburger button and menu items
- CSS includes flex layout for desktop and absolute positioning with transforms for mobile
- Media query breakpoint set at `max-width: 768px`
- Transform animations using `translateY()` for slide effect

## Success Criteria
- Menu behavior is stable at exactly 768px viewport width
- No unexpected sliding animations when resizing browser window
- Smooth transitions maintained for intended responsive behavior
- Clean, working CSS that addresses the root cause

## Scope Limitations
- Focus only on CSS fixes - no HTML modifications
- No JavaScript required for the core fix
- Maintain existing design aesthetics and functionality

## Task Classification
**Level 1: Quick Bug Fix** - This is a focused CSS debugging and patching task with clear, specific requirements and limited scope.
